## Getting Started
 You need 2 players to play the game!


To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites
- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) installed on your machine

### Setup
Clone or download the source code, and run it in your teminal.

### Game instructions
Start the game by running this code in your teminal `bin/main.rb`.


You start the game by entering your names, then the computer will randomly choose one of you to choose his sign. You can only choose "x" or "o".
After choosing your signs, the first player will choose from 1-9 to put his sign in that index as shown in below image:

Once the first player choose an index, that index will be changed to his sign as shown below:

Then it's other player turn. The second player now should choose his sign in order not to allow the first player to win.
